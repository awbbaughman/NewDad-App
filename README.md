# NewDad-App
[Capstone project for Institute of Data]

An App for new dads to connect with their baby and make time for themselves during one of the most transformative periods of their lives.

The NewDad App is a one-stop shop for dads everywhere to learn about their baby and generate fun activities for themselves during one of the most transformative periods of their lives.

NewDad will:
Teach users about their baby’s week-by-week development
Suggest useful activities to keep users engaged while taking care of their child
Provide a helpful calendar to log a user’s activities
