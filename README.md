# NewDad-App
[Capstone project for Institute of Data]

An App for new dads to connect with their baby and make time for themselves during one of the most transformative periods of their lives.

Learn about your baby as they develop each week, and get automated suggestions for activities and exercises to keep yourself occupied. Log and review your progress in the app's calendar.
